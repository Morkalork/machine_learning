# Machine Learning

This is a project I'm using to test things out during a course I'm taking in machine learning, as well as doing tasks
from lessons etc.

This is not of use to anyone but me, so if you've made it this far into the README you are probably wasting much more
time than you should. Be gone!

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Misc

Thanks to Daniel Whitenack (@dwhitena) for a great course and to tretton37 for organizing this 10 week thingymahoo!
